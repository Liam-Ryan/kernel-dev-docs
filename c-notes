--Static--

Variables
- Remain in memory while running 
  Calling the following function twice returns in 1 then 2
	int function(void) 
	{
		static int i = 0; 
		i++; 
		return i;
	}  
  i is not re-initialized since it is static
- Are allocated in the data segment ( on the heap ) rather than stack
- Are initialised as 0, not garbage, if not specifically initialised
- Can only be initialised using constants
	const int x = 10; //this is fine
	const int x = do_a_thing(); // compiler error
- static global functions or variables restrict access to the current file

Functions
- global by default but static restricts access to the file it's declared in
