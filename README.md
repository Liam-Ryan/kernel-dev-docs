### Backup of my notes for kernel development
I don't expect these notes to be useful for anyone else, they're just a way to back up my notes as I progress in kernel development

Please note that a lot of the code examples are adapted from examples in books I'm studying, they're not guaranteed to work. 

Content may be paraphrased or taken verbatim from study texts, please do not take this collection of notes as my original work rather this is a collection of references
